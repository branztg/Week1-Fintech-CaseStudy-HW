This will be my repo for submitting my HW 1.

# Square (Financial Services)

## Overview and Origin

* Square was founded on 2009 by Twitter co-Founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey.

* He had the idea of making a his own payment gateway 
  afer being unable to complete a transaction because the merchant does not accept a credit card.

* After multiple iterations and developments, Dorsey and co. expanded the business into Block inc. Which
  houses multiple subcompanies including Cash App, Weebly, and Afterpay.


## Business Activities

* Square is a totally seamless and easy to use Commerce, Customer, Banking, and Staffing software management solution.

* Square markets itself as an optimal solution for small to mid size stores. Although theoretically there is
  no limit to the data you can use, which means it can also be used by bigger businesses.
  
* Their Ideal Customers range from Restaurants, Retail, Beauty, Services, and more. 

* Square provides a seamless integration of Inhouse and on-the-go payments, Inventory management, Customer information,
  as well as staff scheduling and wages.

* Their website and mobile app are integrated into multiple kinds of cash registers, credit card readers, scanners, and other devices.

* The website and app hosts a multitude of different services like 
  * Point of sale for website, in-house, and social media transactions
  * Direct customer marketing, messaging, and loyalty programs
  * Business banking 
  * Staff permissions, timecards, and payrolls

* Square also has Developer support and API which can easily connect third-party apps or build custom solutions and features.


## Landscape

* Square is positioned well in the small to mid-size retail finance trasnsaction market, because they are
  the most complete service available. 

* The trend for the last decade in this space has been the movement to a major online presence and transactions.

* Square has gotten ahead of this by constantly updating their website, developer support, mobile app, and physical products like
  card readers and cash registers.

* Because Square is a complete solution, competitors have tried to specialize in specific aspects of retail in order to compete.
  for example:
  * Payment Depot - specializes in high volume business
  * Helcim - Best solution for business on a budget
  * Toast - Specializes in restaurants
  * Shopify - Specializes in ecommerce


## Results

* Square has been a big player in the market with 2 million merchants (Nov/2017) and 210 Million users (Jan,2021)

## Recommendations

* I suggest integrating pa pay in 4 solution like afterpay which is also a Block inc. company, in order to accomodate bigger purchases from customers.

* This would be very beneficial as it would drive new kinds of possible transactions. 

* This would utilize recurring transactions from customers, instead of one time transactions like it commonly processes.

* This technology would definitely move the needle forward as it will accomodate a new way of payment.
